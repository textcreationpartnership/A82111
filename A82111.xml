         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOraſmuch as we believe many <hi>godly people</hi> in theſe <hi>three Nations</hi> and elſewhere, are deceived (and therefore <hi>unſatisfied</hi>) concerning us in the <hi>matters</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> relating to the moſt precious <hi>Cauſe, Interest,</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the Lord Chriſt, (which we cleave unto) through <hi>miſrepreſentations</hi> and <hi>falſe reports</hi> made of us and our <hi>Principles,</hi> by <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> poſted about the <hi>Nations</hi> for that purpoſe, full of <hi>errours, miſtakes, unchristian cenſures, uncharitable reproaches</hi> and <hi>invectives,</hi> wherein the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> have all the <hi>advantage</hi> againſt us that <hi>worldly power</hi> can poſſeſs them with: But now, that we may no longer (by a <hi>forced ſilence</hi>) be a <hi>diſſatisfaction</hi> to our friends, <hi>grievance</hi> to the truth, <hi>offence</hi> to the Saints, a <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to our own conſciences, and <hi>advantage</hi> to the Adverſaries, or be ſo much the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> (as we have been) of our <hi>Enemies</hi> malice, to forge their lyes, jealouſies, or evil reports upon, nor yet be <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> to many, and for <hi>ſignes</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> to moſt in the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as if we were <hi>monſters,</hi> and not <hi>men; infidels,</hi> and not <hi>believers, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to <hi>Government,</hi> and not <hi>Orators</hi> for it day and night, as God hath appointed it: We ſhall therefore (in the behalf of thouſands more (we hope) one with us herein) in all <hi>faithfulneſs, meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>clearneſs,</hi> declare unto you, (and to all the world) how far we are <hi>engaged</hi> in this moſt <hi>glorious</hi> (though crucified) <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> (mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all oppoſition of Men or Devils) in as little room as this ſhort Narrative will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us, being awakened thereunto every day.

            <p>O our <hi>bowels!</hi> our <hi>bowels!</hi> our <hi>hearts</hi> even ake, and are pained within us, to hear the doleful and daily <hi>groans</hi> of Gods people, crying out, O where are our <hi>Deliverers</hi> and <hi>Saviours!</hi> The <hi>reeds</hi> that we leaned upon, have <hi>pierced</hi> our hands, and we <hi>bleed!</hi> and after our <hi>eyes</hi> fail with <hi>looking</hi> for <hi>Freedom, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> behold <hi>Darkneſs, Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Diſtraction,</hi> more then ever! and what hope is left us? And all this through the declenſion of the <hi>Armies</hi> firſt <hi>Principles,</hi> and former <hi>Declarations,</hi> extant to the view of the <hi>World:</hi> Witneſs pag. 14, 15. of the Remonſtr. <hi>Albans,</hi> and pag. 66. They urge it upon the grounds of <hi>Common right, Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> that <hi>Parliaments</hi> be by a <hi>certain ſucceſſion, Annually, or Biennially.</hi> And in their Declar. <hi>June</hi> 14. 1647. pag. 8, 9. they declare this ſo <hi>eſſential and fundamental to Freedom, as that it cannot, nor ought it to be denied or withholden from us: and that arbitrary or abſolute power in any perſon or perſons during life, doth not render that State any better then Tyranny, nor the people ſubjected thereto any better then vaſſals.</hi> And therefore they ſay, pag. 9. <hi>We are ſo far from deſigning or complying to have an abſolute or arbitrary power ſigned or ſetled for continuance in any perſons whatſoever, as that (if we might be ſure to obtain it) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wiſh to have it ſo in the perſons of any whom we could moſt confide in, or who ſhould appear moſt of our own opinions or principles, or whom we might have moſt perſonal aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of, or intereſt in, but that the Authority of this Kingdom in Parliament, may ever ſtand, and have its courſe.</hi> Yet for all this, were not the laſt Parliament diſſolved, for that they would rule as <hi>Saints,</hi> (or part of the fifth Monarchy, for Chriſt?) and for doing that the former Parliament neglected, and therefore were diſſolved? and for doing that which the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>good people</hi> had many yeers declared to be their duty to do? <hi>viz.</hi> Remonſtr. p. 20. And have not ſome by <hi>Printing</hi> opprobriouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly <hi>abuſed</hi> thoſe <hi>precious Members</hi> that ſtood for the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>

Beſides, doth not this <hi>perſonal intereſt</hi> now up, look too much <hi>alike</hi> that which God hath <hi>confounded</hi> and <hi>ſtamped upon</hi> before our eyes? in the ſame <hi>predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Pride, Prophaneſs, Perſecution</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> with them that went before? Oh! are not the <hi>Wicked</hi> exalted on every ſide, and ſuch taken up again, (<hi>Malignants</hi> and <hi>others</hi>) as not long ſince they moſt <hi>declaim'd</hi> againſt? and are not the <hi>Saints</hi> (and them onely, or moſtly) afflicted, caſt out of their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> from praying and preaching? and ſome of the faithfulleſt of them in all theſe Wars, now cloſely <hi>impriſoned</hi> (for their Conſciences, and this Cauſe of Chriſt) from the <hi>common air,</hi> yea, caſt among <hi>malefactors</hi> condemned; threatned, reproached, and trampled on? Oh! can we have hearts ſo hard, as to mention theſe, and (many more) ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>effects,</hi> without yerning and mourning? Beſides, are not the new Court of <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> at White-hall for <hi>Miniſters,</hi> of like make with the <hi>Biſhops High-Commiſſion-Court?</hi> The <hi>graven image</hi> of the <hi>worldly power,</hi> creating a <hi>worldly clergie,</hi> for <hi>worldly ends,</hi> highly ſcandalous, &amp; againſt the rule of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and faith of Chriſt, and as much to be <hi>exploded</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelate?</hi> Notwithſtanding they aſſume the title of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> and <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> of opinion to themſelves, and upon that account charge others (that are not one with them in their <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>Antichristian interest</hi>) with Errors and <hi>raſhneſs.</hi> But, as the Declaration of the Army to <hi>Scotland</hi> (page 15.) ſaith, <hi>This hath been found in all ages of high advantage to them that aſſumed it, that it were ſtrange if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171762:2"/>thoſe</hi> (Civil Tryers) <hi>ſhould not have uſed it to ſmite them withal, whom they would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der odious and deſtroy.</hi> And is not <hi>this</hi> againſt their own Declaration to <hi>Scotland,</hi> pag. 6. where they ſay, <hi>That that Church-Government which is of God, God's own means,</hi> viz. <hi>his Word, must eſtabliſh, without a buſie medling with, or engaging of the Authorities of the world?</hi> And the Lord General <hi>CROMWEL</hi> in his Letter to the Kirk-Aſſembly from <hi>Dunbar,</hi> page 11. ſaith, <hi>It is worth conſideridg, how thoſe Miniſters take into their hands the inſtruments of a fooliſh ſhepherd, that meddle with worldly Policies, or Earthly Powers, to ſet up that which they call the kingdom of Chriſt, which indeed is neither it, nor if it were, would ſuch means be found effectual for that end, and neglect, and truſt not to the Word of God, the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Is not this <hi>all</hi> true in the <hi>Tryers?</hi> And is not this alſo againſt their own Remonſtrance <hi>Albans,</hi> page 20. where they declare it the Parliaments part, <hi>to protect religious men, and take away all the corrupted Forms of outſide-Religion, and</hi> (National) <hi>Church-ſtate, whether impoſed without Law, or rooted in Law in times of Popiſh Ignorance or Idolatry, or of Goſpels dimmer light; and alſo to take away the dependence of the</hi> (National) <hi>clergie in Civil Laws and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs, which they had upon the King; or that intereſt of the Clergie in Civil Laws and Affairs, which the craft of both in length of time had wrought for each other: But that the King's part was to diſcountenance the Godly, or any conſcience obliging above or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt humane or outward Conſtitutions, and to uphold and maintain the Civil dependence of the Clergie, and their Church-matters under him.</hi> Our <hi>bowels</hi> are ſo moved at theſe things, that we cannot refrain from <hi>bewailing</hi> our condition, after ſo vaſt a ſtream and treaſure of the blood, tears, prayers, lives, and ſpoils of our deareſt relations. O did we ever think to ſee ſo many <hi>hopeful Inſtruments</hi> in the Army, Churches, and <hi>elſewhere,</hi> to be ſo fully <hi>gorged</hi> with the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Kings, Captains, and Nobles? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> with their <hi>Lands, Mannors, Eſtates, Parks,</hi> and <hi>Palaces</hi>) ſo as to ſit at <hi>eaſe,</hi> and comply with Antichriſt, the World, Worldly Church and Clergie: Oh! how hath the Cup of the <hi>Whore</hi> foxt and inchanted men! <hi>viz.</hi> with the wine of the wrath of her <hi>Fornication,</hi> to commit <hi>ſin</hi> with her daily, (which the <hi>ſober</hi> bluſh to ſee) and to <hi>paint</hi> her over afreſh, for <hi>New lovers</hi> to lie down with, to their utter ruine! O the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> works apace! This ſubtil <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of Antichriſtianiſm (in a New body) hath <hi>bewitched</hi> many of the <hi>Common ſort,</hi> and is wonderful cunning to deceive; although by this <hi>univerſal Falling away</hi> amongſt us, the <hi>man of ſin</hi> is (bleſſed by <hi>Jehovah</hi>) more diſcovered then ever, who muſt be deſtroyed with the <hi>breath</hi> of Chriſt's mouth, and <hi>brightneſs</hi> of his coming.

Therefore in a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>neceſſary defence</hi> of what is dearer to us then our <hi>lives,</hi> (bought with price of the Blood of Chriſt, and thouſands of his deareſt Saints) we call <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to witneſs between Us and our Brethren that have <hi>denied</hi> us and this <hi>Cauſe!</hi> For in Caſes not clearly or properly under man's judgment, or where it is not eaſie for man to give a <hi>certain judgement,</hi> the <hi>Engaged</hi> upon <hi>ſure Principles</hi> and <hi>Pretences</hi> do centre in <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for Judgement: and ſo did the two Tribes and a half, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. for that it is then the <hi>proper work of God</hi> to <hi>bear witneſs,</hi> and <hi>give righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> which as he hath always done, ſoone or later, clearer or darker, after the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> is made to him; ſo in this <hi>laſt age</hi> and <hi>part</hi> of the world he hath made more <hi>haste</hi> then formerly to <hi>judgement,</hi> and given it more quickly, ſpeedily, and terribly, and made his <hi>own Arm</hi> ſo bare therein, as all men might ſee it: witneſs the foreſaid <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> at <hi>Dunbar.</hi> In the ſame <hi>Cauſe</hi> the <hi>Appeal</hi> is now made (by us) again.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="8">8. Whereas they ſay, we are <hi>all for Wars,</hi> and would have <hi>no Peace</hi> with the nations round about; we appeal to God therein, whether we are not for the beſt, ſafeſt, and laſting (godly) Peace? and, were it God's will, could wiſh no more blood might be ſhed!

CROMWEL.</hi> In the mean time, men would do well to take heed of <hi>blaſpheming,</hi> reproaching Chriſt, his <hi>Spirit</hi> and his <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as they do daily (for which our hearts are grieved within us) and to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures</hi> whether theſe things be ſo or no. For as the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> writes, in his own Letter to the Kirk of <hi>Scotland, The Word of the Lord may be to ſome a word of judgement, that they may fall backward, and be broken, and ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and taken; there may be a ſpiritual fulneſs, which the world may call a drunkenneſs,</hi> (or giddineſs) <hi>Act.</hi> 2. O that we might beſeech ſuch in the bleeding <hi>bowels</hi> of Chriſt, (crucified before our eyes) to think it poſſible they may be miſtaken! Though the <hi>Great Ones,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe Ones, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Rulers, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Profeſſors</hi> (ſo accounted of the <hi>times</hi>) were all on their ſide; yet a little handful of the <hi>weak ones</hi> may have the <hi>Truth</hi> (though but the deſpiſed perſecuted <hi>truth</hi>) on their ſide. And we do in the <hi>tenderneſs</hi> of our hearts and affections to all that are <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> beg of them in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> (who is coming to raign <hi>righteouſly</hi> and <hi>gloriouſly</hi>) that they will have nothing to do with them that are <hi>guilty</hi> of ſo great <hi>ſins,</hi> leſt partaking of their <hi>ſins,</hi> they partake alſo of their <hi>Plagues.</hi> And we hope the Lord will enable us to undergo the <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> of this <hi>Day,</hi> for our dear <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> through the <hi>Reproaches, Impriſonments, Perſecutions, unjuſt Charges, uncivil Raylings,</hi> or <hi>un-Goſpel Carriages,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>We ſhall cloſe at preſent with our heartieſt <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications,</hi> That God the Father of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would in his <hi>due time</hi> caſt down all thoſe <hi>carnal, earthly, cruel,</hi> and <hi>political Combinations</hi> of men (of all ſorts) that would not have him to <hi>Reign over us,</hi> but ſet up themſelves, and their <hi>own</hi> corrupted <hi>Interests,</hi> in the room of that <hi>Scepter</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which he hath given into the hands of his dear <hi>Son;</hi> that he would by his <hi>Spirit</hi> (reſting and abiding upon you and us) keep up all our hearts in a <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>patient waiting</hi> for his <hi>coming</hi> till he <hi>comes:</hi> Even ſo <hi>come quickly,</hi> Lord Jeſus <hi>come quickly.</hi>
